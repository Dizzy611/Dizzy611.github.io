## Project Description

The artifact chosen for the Databases requirement is a demonstration of data visualization on Jupyter Notebook using Dash and Plotly. It was created in July of 2021 as a part of the CS-340 course “Client/Server Development”, intended to teach interaction with NoSQL databases such as MongoDB. It is included in my ePortfolio because I believed I could improve upon its basic functionality and make the data visualization in question more useful and helpful. Specifically, the original dashboard assignment uses a fair bit of hard coding including adding a map marker that only points to the very first row of the data frame. Therefore, I sought to remove as much hardcoding as possible, including having all relevant map markers (truncated to 100 if there are >100 rows) displayed. 


## Skills demonstrated, improvements made

I believe the improved artifact showcases my general skills in research as applied to understanding the Pandas API, specifically in terms of learning how to iterate over each row in a pandas dataframe and retrieve and store the requisite data. I believe it also showcases an understanding of Dash, and of how to modify a Dash map to add further data. 


## Skills learned and expanded

Enhancing this artifact was a far more difficult process than I initially expected, which lead to its late completion and to it lacking some intended improvements. I ran into multiple issues stretching across weeks attempting to get the dashboard to actually run on my local system, as opposed to the Apporto environment it was originally designed to run in, as well as sourcing the particular dataset used in the original course, which was again part of an Apporto environment I no longer had access to. Issues that I have yet to solve include an intermittent 404 from Jupyter Notebook instead of the intended endpoint. In the end, I believe the biggest skill learned in the process of improving this particular artifact was in troubleshooting the various upstream bugs and environment issues involved. Frankly, I do not think I will be using Jupyter Notebook or Dash again.
